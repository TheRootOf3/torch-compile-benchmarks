(And how do they know they\u2019re there?)\nAstronomers have been able to detect exoplanets for a while now, but how do they know they\u2019re there? The answer is a lot of data, and a lot of math. Here\u2019s a quick rundown of how astronomers detect exoplanets.\nThe first step is to find a planet. Astronomers use a technique called \u201ctransit\u201d to find planets. A planet transits, or passes in front of, its star. This happens when the planet passes between the star and the observer. The star\u2019s light is blocked by the planet, and the observer sees a dimmer star. Astronomers can use this dimming to calculate the mass of the planet.\nOnce astronomers have found a planet, they can use the data to calculate its mass. They can also use the data to calculate the planet\u2019s size. Astronomers can", "Explain the relationship between inflation and interest rates.
