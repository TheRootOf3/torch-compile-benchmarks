Quantum mechanics is a branch of physics that studies the physical properties of matter and other subatomic particles at the atomic and subatomic level. It is the science of the structure and properties of matter. It is one of the two pillars of modern physics, the other being classical mechanics. Quantum mechanics is the foundation of modern technology, including computers, telecommunications, and medical imaging. Quantum mechanics is also the basis for the theory of relativity.

CRISPR stands for Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats, and it is a type of gene editing that uses short pieces of DNA to target specific genes. CRISPR gene editing works by using a guide RNA (gRNA) to bind to a specific DNA sequence in the target gene, which then triggers the cleavage of the DNA strand. This process is called CRISPR-Cas9, and it is the most commonly used form of CRISPR gene editing.\nCRISPR gene editing is a powerful tool for scientists to manipulate the genetic code of living organisms.
